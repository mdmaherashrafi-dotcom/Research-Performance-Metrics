# Research Performance & AI Validation Metrics Suite
**Quantifying Efficiency and Accuracy in Scientific Research & AI Model Training (2023 - Present)**

---

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a technical portfolio to validate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and data-driven methodologies implemented during my tenure at **AxiomNova Research Centre** and as a **Research Analyst / AI Subject Matter Expert (SME)**. 

The core engine demonstrates how **Python** and **SQL** are integrated to automate research workflows, ensuring high-precision data integrity for large-scale scientific datasets and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) models.

## Proven Performance Metrics (CV Highlights)
This project provides the algorithmic proof for the following achievements:

* **25% - 30% Efficiency Gain:** Automated complex data cleaning and ETL pipelines using Python/Pandas, drastically reducing manual processing time.
* **99.9% Data Integrity:** Rigorous validation and error analysis across 30,000+ scientific data points in the domains of Chemistry and Biology.
* **98% Model Accuracy:** Refined AI reasoning via RLHF, maintaining strict factual accuracy in technical prompts.
