# 🚀 Research Performance & AI Validation Suite
### **Advanced Analytical Engine for High-Precision Research Auditing & RLHF Validation**
Developed by **MD MAHER ASHRAFI** *Research Analyst | AI Operations Specialist | Founder & CEO at AxiomNova*

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository hosts a production-ready **Analytical Suite** designed to automate research performance auditing. Built with integrated **Python-SQL architectures**, it validates critical KPIs such as **99.9% data integrity** and **25% processing efficiency**. The system handles large-scale scientific datasets, ensuring that AI-driven research (RLHF) remains factually consistent and optimized for global scale.

> **The Goal:** Transforming raw manual scientific research into an automated, AI-validated pipeline with zero margin for error.
