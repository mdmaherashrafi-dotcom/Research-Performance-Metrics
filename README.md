## 📖 Project Overview
This repository serves as a technical portfolio to validate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and data-driven methodologies implemented at **AxiomNova Research Centre**. 

The core engine demonstrates how **Python and SQL** are integrated to automate research workflows, ensuring high-precision data integrity for large-scale scientific datasets and **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** models.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture for seamless data flow and high scalability, similar to professional NLP pipelines.

## 🔬 Methodology & Core Workflow
The analytical framework is built on a high-concurrency model to ensure that scientific research parameters are audited without data loss.

### 1. Data Ingestion Phase
Using optimized **SQL queries**, we simulate a high-volume environment to fetch scientific logs from our internal databases. This ensures that every entry follows the predefined schema for Chemistry and Biology datasets.

### 2. Analytical Processing (Python Engine)
The core engine utilizes **Pandas and NumPy** to calculate standard deviations and error margins. The RLHF validation layer specifically looks for:
* Factual inconsistencies in technical prompts.
* Anomalies in automated research cycles.
* Efficiency bottleneck identification.

---

## 🛠️ Extended Technical Stack
Beyond core Python and SQL, the project demonstrates proficiency in:

* **Data Governance**: Maintaining strict 99.9% integrity protocols.
* **RLHF Fine-tuning**: Improving AI model responses through expert human evaluation.
* **Automated Reporting**: Generating real-time efficiency dashboards (Matplotlib/Seaborn).
* **Version Control**: Expert management of collaborative research via Git/GitHub.

## 📈 Future Roadmaps
- [ ] Integration with real-time API for live research auditing.
- [ ] Enhancing the AI validation layer with Deep Learning frameworks.
- [ ] Developing a web-based UI for interactive performance tracking.
