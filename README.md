# Research Performance & AI Validation Metrics Suite
**Quantifying Efficiency and Accuracy in Scientific Research & AI Model Training (2023 - Present)**

---

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a technical portfolio to validate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and data-driven methodologies implemented during my tenure at **AxiomNova Research Centre** and as a **Research Analyst / AI Subject Matter Expert (SME)**. 

The core engine demonstrates how **Python** and **SQL** are integrated to automate research workflows, ensuring high-precision data integrity for large-scale scientific datasets and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) models.
