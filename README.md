# Research Performance & AI Validation Metrics Suite
**Quantifying Efficiency and Accuracy in Scientific Research & AI Model Training (2023 - Present)**

---

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a technical portfolio to validate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and data-driven methodologies implemented during my tenure at **AxiomNova Research Centre** and as a **Research Analyst / AI Subject Matter Expert (SME)**. 

The core engine demonstrates how **Python** and **SQL** are integrated to automate research workflows, ensuring high-precision data integrity for large-scale scientific datasets.

---

## Proven Performance Metrics (CV Highlights)
* **25% - 30% Efficiency Gain:** Automated complex data cleaning and ETL pipelines using Python/Pandas.
* **99.9% Data Integrity:** Rigorous validation across 30,000+ scientific data points in Chemistry and Biology.
* **98% Model Accuracy:** Refined AI reasoning via RLHF, maintaining strict factual accuracy.
