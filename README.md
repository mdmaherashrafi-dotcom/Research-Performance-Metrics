## 📖 Project Overview
This repository serves as a technical portfolio to validate the key performance indicators (KPIs) and data-driven methodologies implemented at **AxiomNova Research Centre**. 

The core engine demonstrates how **Python and SQL** are integrated to automate research workflows, ensuring high-precision data integrity for large-scale scientific datasets and **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** models.
